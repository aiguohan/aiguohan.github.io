I'm an Research Assistant Professor at UIUC.

## Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in Data Mining Problems and Applications:
- Text Mining, Information Extraction, and Natural Language Processing
- Structured Mining in Large-Scale Text-Rich Networks
- Understanding and Improving Deep Neural Networks
- Interdisciplinary Applications (e.g., Biomedical, IoT, ...)

Most of my research projects focus on (1) developing principled data-driven approaches with light human effort and (2) building effective and robust machine learning models in an efficient way.

## Prospective Students

I'm actively recruiting students who are excited about doing fun research. My lab has openings for PhD students and research internship opportunities for master/undergrad students (UIUC or external). Please check the following items before sending me an email.

- **Applicants for UIUC PhD Program**: Please make sure that you have applied online and select my name as one of the faculty members that you wish to work with.
- **Research Internship Opportunities**:
    * **If you are currently at UIUC**: I only take students who (1) have a clear research problem/objective and some initial ideas; (2) have relevant research experiences or have strong background in math/stats/physics; and (3) could devote enough time on research. Please highlight these in your email including a time plan.
    * **If you are not at UIUC** (e.g., Summer Internship): Visitors are mostly recommended by my collaborators and have their own funding support. The minimum duration of stay at UIUC is 12 weeks (preferably 6 months - 1 year). Please indicate the time range in your email.

**In your email**, please include the following items:
- Title as "Prospective Student: YourName - YourAffliation"
- Briefly introduce what research problem that you are interested in. What are the current state-of-the-art solutions and why do you think you can further improve over them?
- Briefly introduce yourself, including education background, research experiences, and programming skills.
- Briefly explain your motivations and expectations of working with me.
- Include a PDF version of your CV.
